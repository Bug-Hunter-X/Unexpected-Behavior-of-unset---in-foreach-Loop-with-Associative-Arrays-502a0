This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP related to using the `unset()` function within a `foreach` loop when iterating over associative arrays.  The problem arises because modifying the array during iteration can interfere with the internal pointer, leading to unexpected results.  The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.php` illustrates a corrected approach.
